##dminiwm
### it's minimal and dynamic

I started this from catwm 31/12/10 ( https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=100215&p=1 )
See dminiwm.c or config.h for thanks and licensing.


###Summary
-------


**dminiwm** is a very minimal and lightweight dynamic tiling window manager.
    I will try to stay under 1000 SLOC.
    Currently under 900 lines with the config file included.


###Modes
-----

It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers(with the new window as the master)
    and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack(like dwm's attach_aside)

 *There's vertical tiling mode:*

    --------------
    |        | W |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

 *Horizontal tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    | W |   |   |
    -------------
    
 *Grid tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |      |    |
    |      |    |
    |------|----|
    |      |    |
    -------------

 *Fullscreen mode*(which you'll know when you see it)

 All accessible with keyboard shortcuts defined in the config.h file.
 
 * The window W at the top of the stack can be resized on a per desktop basis.
 * Changing a tiling mode on one workspace doesn't affect the other workspaces.


###Recent Changes

    # make install
    $ make clean
