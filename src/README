I started this from catwm 31/12/10 ( https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=100215&p=1 )
See dminiwm.c or config.h for thanks and licensing.


Summary
-------


dminiwm is a very minimal and lightweight dynamic tiling window manager.
    I will try to stay under 1000 SLOC.
    Currently well under 800 lines with the config file included.


Modes
-----

It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers(with the new window as the master)
    and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack(like dwm's attach_aside)

    There's vertical tiling mode:
    --------------
    |        | W |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

    There's horizontal tiling mode:
    --------------
    |            |
    |   Master   |
    |____________|
    |       |    |
    |   W   |    |
    --------------

    Fullscreen mode(which you'll know when you see it)

    All accessible with keyboard shortcuts defined in the config.h file.
    The window W at the top of the stack can be resized on a per desktop basis.
    Changing a tiling mode on one workspace doesn't affect the other workspaces.


Recent Changes

Need Xlib, then:

    # make install
    $ make clean
